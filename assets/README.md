# The assets folder

This directory contains two things

## `oculus-go-controller.glb`

This is the model of the Oculus Go controller that was extracted from the Unity package

## `menu_*.jpg`

These are the menus used in the application. They are created by the `geb_menu.rb` script which will create a bunch of `.png` files. These need to be converted from `.png` to `.jpg` by the `convert.sh` script
