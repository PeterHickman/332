# Introduction

My Father was in the military and we tended to move every 3 to 4 years so we always lived in Army supplied accomodation. Approaching the end of his career he was told that Whitehall would be his last posting. So my parents prepared to buy their first and only home. 332 Richmond Road was stripped back to the bricks and floorboards and decorated as they wanted. Paintings and ornaments that had been accumulated over the decades could now finally be placed with a sense of permanance. The house changed little over the subsequent years. The original decor was never updated, some additional ornaments were purchaced, broken appliances were replaced but the feel of the house remained unchanged

The pictures were taken in July 2018. Our Mother had already passed and the house was starting to be decluttered to make it more accessable for Father. The colours had become bleached and everything felt worn and tired. When they were both active the house was much less bleak

I was house-sitting and it was a sunny day so I took some shots around the house

Although I can occasionaly remember the way it was when I was living there and going down the road to school these are the strongest memories I have of 332. The feeling of time slowing down and gentle decay

The house was sold and a new family has again stripped it back to the bricks and floorboards and built their new home there
